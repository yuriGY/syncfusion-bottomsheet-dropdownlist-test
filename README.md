# syncfusion-bottomsheet-dropdownlist-test

The objective of this project is to provide replicable and tangible evidence regarding the behavior of syncfusion's dropdownlist component inside a bottom sheet.

This test is supposed to be held on a mobile decive in order to demonstrate how the bottom sheet closes, whenever an item from the dropdownlist component is selected. Which is a different behavior from the same interaction on desktop devices, where the bottom sheet stays open.
